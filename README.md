## Getting and Cleaning Data

### Introduction

1 - The repository contains the analysis script for the course project. The data was downloaded from a data site pertaining to the analysis of "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones". (Specifically, the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone).

2 - The analysis script creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. (run_analysys.R)

3 - The CodeBook (CodeBook.md) provides a description of the variables and the analysis steps. 


4 - The output file is a text file titled "average_data_variable.txt".
